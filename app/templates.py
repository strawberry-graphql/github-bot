MISSING_RELEASE_FILE = """\
Hi, thanks for contributing to Strawberry üçì!

We noticed that this PR is missing a `RELEASE.md` file. \
We use that to automatically do releases here on GitHub and, \
most importantly, to PyPI!

So as soon as this PR is merged, a release will be made üöÄ.

Here's an example of `RELEASE.md`:

```markdown
Release type: patch

Description of the changes, ideally with some examples, if adding a new feature.
```

Release type can be one of patch, minor or major. We use [semver](https://semver.org/),\
 so make sure to pick the appropriate type. If in doubt feel free to ask :)

RELEASE_FILE_ADDED = """
Thanks for adding the `RELEASE.md` file!
